This is my lab 04 submission. The code I edited is located in src/app/home/
home.page.html.

There was not much to do for this lab. I already had some experience via 
working on the homework with ionic projects and how to get them started,
build them, and make them run. This lab, for me, was more of a recap. 

I am becoming more and more confident using Ionic and typescript. The 
HTML files, however, are a lot of fun to work with. And I hope I can get 
some front end development experience with html in the future.
