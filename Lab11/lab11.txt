Exercise 11.1
For our homeworks, labs, project etc. we have been using ts.lint to help us preserve
formatting consistency. Professor Vander-linden told us this is okay since we are using 
vscode and it ts.lint automatically gives us warnings when a potential bug or 
formatting inconsistency arises.
